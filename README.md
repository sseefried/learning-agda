# Sean Seefried learns Agda

This repository collects examples of things I have learned
while studying Agda. Posts in here are written in Literate Agda
using Markdown so that they can be rendered nicely in GitHub.

These files can be loaded by Agda however and I encourage the
reader to do this.

Modules in here should be self-contained and get posted
here usually after I experienced some kind of difficulty
learning something. If I spent more than an hour trying to
define something "easy" it'll probably end up here.
